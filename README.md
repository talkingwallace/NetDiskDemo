# A small sized netdisk 
### Based on ReactJS,NodeJS and MongoDB

# * How to run it

After you download the project:

1.Firstly download Mongodb from:https://www.mongodb.com/ <br>
then install it.After installing it,create a new folder,mongodb will store data <br>
in it.Then open Powershell(CMD is also ok),locate at the place where mongodb are <br>
installed in,input: mongod.exe --dbpath:"the new folder's path",and then the mo- <br>
-ngodb is launched. <br>
Mongodb will run on port 27017,27017 is a default value; <br>

2.Get NodeJS from:https://nodejs.org/en/ ,install it. <br>
Now you can run Javascript scripts in you computer.Locate at the project folder, <br>
input "node server.js",the server will run and connect to the database which  is <br>
running on local port 27017.The server itself will run on local port 8000. <br>
You can change the running port in the source file 'server.js'. <br>

3.Now the server is running,open Chrome and input: localhost:8000,you can visit  <br>
the website now,Sign in and sign up! <br>


# * Place it on Cloud Sever

It's simple to place it on a Tencent Yun Server.Get a server from: <br>
https://cloud.tencent.com/ Connect to the Yun server,upload the project,and <br>
install Mongodb,NodeJS on it.Run it on the Yun server,like runnint it on your <br>
computer.You will get an ip,the outer ip after buying a server,so just open <br>
Chrome,input "the outer ip"+"port",press enter,then you will find yourself <br>
having your own netdisk website. <br>

Warning:If you don't get your domain name a ICP licensing,you are likely to <br>
be asked to shut down the server. <br>
Because http://www.cac.gov.cn/ is watching you. <br>
